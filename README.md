# landing-page

Project two for The Odin Project:

I was given a design style sheet with some colors, fonts, and sizes as well as an image of the general layout of the page.

First, I created the HTML with the exact elements and placeholders to match the example. Then, I added the CSS styling to the HTML elements I had created.
